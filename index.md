# What are ordinals good for?

- Ordinals are simple and aesthetic. Where aesthetics trump other
  considerations, ordinals may be the way to go. For NFTs, I don't think they
  can be beat.
- All state is on-chain. Can verify everything from on-chain state.

---

# What are ordinals not good for?

- Serious adult things
- Not making weird transactions to avoid the dust limit
- Being efficient with block space
- Extremely high divisibility (one ordinal is always one sat, after all)
- Lots of state to verify by signing devices

# NFTs on ordinals

- Create the metadata
- Sign metadata | ordinal with pubkey -> NFT
- NFT can be shared. Anyone who has the NFT will know the secret, hidden
  meaning of the ordinals.
